# Sample Paper

# Each item in paper is consisted of three columns, the question index, the option type and the option literal
# question index is a number starting from 1
# option type is a letter indicating the type of current line. 
#   In this implementation, the following options are supported:
#   * Q: question description
#   * A, B, C, D, E, F, G: selection of answer, support up to 7 option for each problem
# option literal is a string representation of current line
# 
# Since each line is started by the index of the question, the specific order of lines in this file is irrelavent.
# When processing this document, the whole document will be sorted in string order, thus there is no guarantee that 
# the latter option in this file can override the one with the same index and option type

# The answer is not presented in this file for seperation.
# To configure the corresponding answer of this paper for automated checking, change the configuration entry in
# "./server-answer.conf" (relative to this file)
